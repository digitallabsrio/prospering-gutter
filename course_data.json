  "course_overview": "There are numerous processes and services in DevOps that you might come across in your career. This course doesn’t just dive into a single tool or process; it helps you become proficient in many different tools and processes of DevOps.\n\nIn this course, you will start by covering Kubernetes services with AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud with Terraform as the main management tools. You’ll move further on to serverless deployment and discuss all the pros and cons of such techniques. By the end of this course, you’ll have received plenty of hands-on practice and exposure to multiple DevOps processes and services. In simpler terms, think of each chapter as a crash course in technologies with outcomes you can use right away. \n\nBy the time you’re done with this course, you will have mastered everything there is to know about the latest deployment and integrations as well as the major tools at our disposal. The aim is to get you up to speed fast while producing beneficial real-world results.",
